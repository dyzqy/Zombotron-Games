# How to play flash games?

All you have to do is follow these steps:
- First, Install [Flash Player](https://github.com/dyzqy/Zombotron-Games/raw/main/Flash%20Player.exe), its where you can play the flash games
- (it will tell you to Either Preserve or Delete, click on **Preserve**, you will also have to do this for the .swf/Flash file)
- Second, Download one of the flash games(they end with .swf), for example [**Zombotron 2**](https://github.com/dyzqy/Zombotron-Games/raw/main/Flash%20Games/Zombotron%202.swf)
